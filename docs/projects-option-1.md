# Projects at Euclid’s Toolworks—Option 1

*Hey, woodshop pals! I’m knee-deep in sawdust at Euclid’s Toolworks, learning hand tool woodworking and chasing geometric vibes. Here’s what’s on my bench—jump in with a comment or subscribe to swap shop stories!*

### Building the Foundation
- **Shop Setup**  
  Sharpening chisels is like taming a wild beast—my diamond stones are winning, but it’s a slog. These tools are my shop’s heartbeat, ready for action! *[See Shop Setup posts](/tag/shop-setup)*

- **Roman Workbench**  
  This workbench is my shop’s tank—hand-cut joinery, old-school grit. Pray I don’t mangle the tenons, okay? *[See Roman Workbench posts](/tag/roman-workbench)*

- **Tool Chest**  
  Building a chest to keep my tools safe, with joinery fancier than my coffee order. It’s my shop’s VIP lounge. *[See Tool Chest posts](/tag/tool-chest)*

### Crafting with Meaning
- **Bookcase Refurbishment**  
  My ‘60s bookcase—former comic stash—is getting Euclid’s geometric carvings. It’s like my shop’s librarian got a tattoo! *[See Bookcase posts](/tag/bookcase)*

- **Other Projects**  
  Euclid’s Door sets, pentagonal photo frames, and a Steinbeck pencil cup are simmering. Big dreams, small shop! *[See Other Projects posts](/tag/other-projects)*
