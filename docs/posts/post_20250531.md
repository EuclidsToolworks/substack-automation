Who was Euclid? What does he have to do with tools, woodworking, or any craft for that matter? Let's hop on into the Wayback machine and see if I can't shed a little light on the first of these questions and then finish up with a little bit more about why he's important to me and my shop, and hopefully to you, since you're reading this.

Euclid's life is a bit of a mystery for us today. Biographies of mathematicians and scholars weren't a big thing at the time he lived.  The best sources we have are probably from Pappus[^1] around 600 to 650 years after Euclid, and Proclus[^2], 700 to 785 years after Euclid. From these we can get a general idea of his life.

Euclid lived and worked around 300 BC during the reign of Ptolemy, in the city of Alexandria in Egypt, an important intellectual center of the time. You may have heard of the famous Library of Alexandria, where Euclid likely worked. He probably studied at Plato's Academy in Athens, or was at least influenced by it's teachings.  Euclid is know as the Father of Geometry.  The primary source for Euclidâ€™s work, ***Elements***[^3],  in thirteen books. In this text Euclid systematized earlier Greek mathematical knowledge (from Thales, Pythagoras, Eudoxus) into a deductive framework using definitions, postulates, and axioms. It became a foundational text for Western mathematics for over 2,000 years.  If you've ever had a geometry class in highschool or college, I'm certain you've seen parts of book 1 almost verbatim.
