# Shop Update

I know I promised you guys an exciting trip through the mists of time in the Wayback Machine to learn about a ***Mathematician***, but trying to put that article together has led me down some interesting rabbit holes, involving deep dives into geometry and the Golden Ratio. I did mention that I was a mathematician.

Anyhow, it's taking longer than planned. Rest assured that I will get there because this particular ***Mathematician*** is important to the story of my shop and how I plan to close out the rest of my days on this earth. I just want to be careful to make sure that article stays in the realm of traditional woodworking instead of me talking to a bunch of other math heads.

## Current state of the shop

Here's a quick look at the shop when we have to park the family vehicle in the garage. One of my sons provided the photos.

As you can probably guess, there are some "demon-possessed," yellow hand tools[^1] in the shop, and those large cardboard boxes on the side contain a 14" bandsaw that I bought to build a "Bulls%$t" Chair. There are actually three usable workbenches in the shop. None of them are suitable for chisel and plane work. I'm building a Roman-style woodworking bench for the heavy work. You can find out more about it in the library.

Speaking of the Library...

## Library Update

I've created a custom page for the Euclid's Toolworks Library for all you folks hungry for traditional woodworking knowledge. I've discovered that the Substack app doesn't put custom pages in the navigation bar, so I'm including the link here. You should be able to see the library in the navigation bar if you're using a web browser instead of the app.

[^1]: For those not in the know, "demon-possessed yellow hand tools" refers to power hand tools of the DeWalt variety. I'm no Luddite, after all.
