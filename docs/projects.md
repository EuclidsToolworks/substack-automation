# Projects at Euclid’s Toolworks

!!! info "Publisher's Note"
    You'll notice that some of the placeholder images on this page are not mine. They are temporary until I can get some snaps of all of this work in progress.  In the cases where I've chosen to use other's images, the links will drive traffic to the appropriate site, where you can find a wealth of knowledge, well worth investigating.

Welcome to the hub for all things project-related! This page lists ETW's woodworking projects, with links to posts diving into the nitty-gritty details—"The Thrill of Vicotory—The Agony of Defeat", all that good stuff. I’ve tossed in extra pics, sketches, and plans where I can, despite Substack’s quirks. Use this as a roadmap for what’s coming up, with placeholders that’ll fill out as I get more details.

## Building the Foundation

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| **Shop Setup** | It seems reasonable that before I can create much with hand tools, I have to make sure they are all ready to work! *[See Shop Setup posts](/tag/shop-setup)*<br>![ShopPile](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/dad_shop.jpg) |
| **Roman Workbench** | I'm planning on making this the main bench for the shop. Chris says it's great for chairs, I hope it will do the job for casework as well. The picture's the goal line and a placeholder until I get the materials finalized. *[See Roman Workbench posts](/tag/roman-workbench)*<br>[![The Goal line](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/roman-workbench-placeholder.jpg)](https://lostartpress.com/products/video-build-a-roman-workbench) |
| **Tool Chest** | Gotta take care of your tools. I believe everyone should build their own tool chest. My first one, made by my machinist grandfather, wasn’t fancy but carried me through four years of high school woodworking classes. This one’s stepping it up a few notches. I haven't decided on a design for the shop tool chest yet, but it will be one of Chris's or Megan's *[See Tool Chest posts](/tag/tool-chest)*<br>[![Euclid’s Tool Chest](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/tool-chest-placeholder.jpg)](https://lostartpress.com/products/american-peasant-signed-by-the-author) |

## Making Bread[^1]

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| **Artisan Geometry Tools** | The plan’s to craft the tools from *Euclid’s Door* as individual tools or sets, using U.S. native woods. *[See Artisan Geometry Tools posts](/tag/geometry-tools)*<br>[![Geometry Tools](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/geometry-tools-placeholder.jpg)](https://www.byhandandeye.com/a-look-through-euclids-door/) |
| **Portable Knock-down Workbench** | There’s a bunch of plans out there, but Mike Taylor’s at Taylor Toolworks is top-notch. I’m tweaking it to make the top MFT-compatible and adding some T-slots for extra flair. *[See Portable Knock-down Workbench posts](/tag/jigs)*<br>![Portable Knock-down Workbench](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/portable-knock-down-workbench.jpg) |

## Crafting with Meaning

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| **Bookcase Restoration** | This bookcase has been with me since I was a kid—probably three or four. It’s getting a full strip-and-refinish, and if I can pull it off, I’ll carve some Christian-inspired designs into the sides. *[See Bookcase posts](/tag/bookcase)*<br>![Bookcase Before](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/bookcase_pile.jpg) |
| **Stick Chairs** | I never thought chairs were my thing—modern ones just didn’t click. Then I saw what Chris Schwarz and others were doing with stick chairs, and my mind changed. Chris works incredibly hard to remove the barriers to chair-making. I guess it worked on me. I’m swapping out my dining chairs for Welsh Stick Chairs to start. Who knows, maybe I’ll sell some later! *[See Stick Chair posts](/tag/stick-chairs)*<br>[![Welsh Stick Chair](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/bs-chair.jpg)](https://lostartpress.com/products/build-a-chair-from-bulls-t) |

*This is just the start for Euclid's Toolworks. What about you? I'd really like to hear what all y'all got goin' on.  Drop me a line—I’d love to hear what you’re up to or what you want me to try next!*
