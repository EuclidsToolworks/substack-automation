# Projects at Euclid’s Toolworks

This page is meant to be an index to project-related goodness. Here you'll find a list of all the projects, links to all the posts related to each project, and as much additional information as I can figure out how to add, given Substack's limitations. The posts will have most of the detail and all of that "thrill of victory"/"agony of defeat" you're looking for. On this page, you'll find additional pictures, sketches, drawings, plans, etc. You can also use it as a guide to upcoming posts, since there will be placeholders that get updated as more detail becomes available.

### Building the Foundation

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| **Shop Setup** | It seems reasonable that before I can create much with hand tools, I have to make sure they are all ready to work! *[See Shop Setup posts](/tag/shop-setup)*<br>![ShopPile](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/dad_shop.jpg) |
| **Roman Workbench** | I'm planning on making this the main bench for the shop. Chris says it's great for chairs, I hope it will do the job for casework as well. The picture's the goal line and a placeholder until I get the materials finalized. *[See Roman Workbench posts](/tag/roman-workbench)*<br>![The Goal line](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/roman-workbench-placeholder.jpg) |
| **Tool Chest** | Sketching a chest with dovetails tight as a drum to keep my tools ready. A shop must, maybe sellable later! *[See Tool Chest posts](/tag/tool-chest)*<br>![Chest dovetails](tool-chest-image.jpg) |

### Making Bread

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| **Artisan Geometry Tools** | Scheming precise geometry tools, like Euclid’s my shop pal, ready for future sales. The thrill’s brewing, agony’s lurking! *[See Geometry Tools posts](/tag/geometry-tools)*<br>![Tool sketch](geometry-tools-image.jpg) |
| **Jigs** | Planning shop jigs to make life smoother—simple but sneaky tough. Can’t wait to sell these time-savers! *[See Jigs posts](/tag/jigs)*<br>![Jig sketch](jigs-image.jpg) |

### Crafting with Meaning

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| **Bookcase Restoration** | This thing has been with me from the very beginning, probably since I was three or four. At the very least it's going get stripped and refinished. If possible, it will get some abstract Christian symbols carved in the sides. *[See Bookcase posts](/tag/bookcase)*<br>![Bookcase Before](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/bookcase_pile.jpg) |
| **Stick Chairs** | Dreaming of swapping my dining chairs for handcrafted stick chairs—thanks, Chris! Joinery’s set to thrill and torment! *[See Stick Chair posts](/tag/stick-chairs)*<br>![Chair sketch](stick-chairs-image.jpg) |
