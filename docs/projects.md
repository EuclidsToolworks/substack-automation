# Projects at Euclidâ€™s Toolworks

This page is meant to be an index to project-related goodness. Here you'll find a list of all the projects, links to all the posts related to each project, and as much additional information as I can figure out how to add, given Substack's limitations. The posts will have most of the detail and all of that "thrill of victory"/"agony of defeat" you're looking for. On this page, you'll find additional pictures, sketches, drawings, plans, etc. You can also use it as a guide to upcoming posts, since there will be placeholders that get updated as more detail becomes available.

## Building the Foundation

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| **Shop Setup** | It seems reasonable that before I can create much with hand tools, I have to make sure they are all ready to work! *[See Shop Setup posts](/tag/shop-setup)*<br>![ShopPile](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/dad_shop.jpg) |
| **Roman Workbench** | I'm planning on making this the main bench for the shop. Chris says it's great for chairs, I hope it will do the job for casework as well. The picture's the goal line and a placeholder until I get the materials finalized. *[See Roman Workbench posts](/tag/roman-workbench)*<br>![The Goal line](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/roman-workbench-placeholder.jpg) |
| **Tool Chest** | You gotta take care of your tools. I'm a firm believer that everyone who uses tools should build the chest that holds them. My first toolbox was made for me by my grandfather.  He was a machinist, not a woodworker so it wasn't much to look at, but it got me through 4 solid years of every woodworking class my school district had to offer. This one will bring things a a few notches. *[See Tool Chest posts](/tag/tool-chest)*<br>![Euclid's Tool Chest]() |

## Making Bread[^1]

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| **Artisan Geometry Tools** | The vision here is to make the tools in *Euclid's Door* available individually and in sets of various woods native to the U.S. These tools were made by the craftsmen who used them from local materials available to them. |
| **Portable Knock-down Workbench** | There are a ton of these types of plans available, but the best I've come across is Mike Taylor's at Taylor Toolworks. I've got some ideas that I want to try out making the top MFT compatable and adding some t-slots. *[See Portable Knock-down Workbench posts](/tag/jigs)*<br>[![portable-knock-down-workbench](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/portable-knock-down-workbench.jpg)](https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/sl/si6O0Pc/portableknockdownbench) |

## Crafting with Meaning

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| **Bookcase Restoration** | This thing has been with me from the very beginning, probably since I was three or four. At the very least it's going get stripped and refinished. If possible, it will get some abstract Christian symbols carved in the sides. *[See Bookcase posts](/tag/bookcase)*<br>![Bookcase Before](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/bookcase_pile.jpg) |
| **Stick Chairs** | I never really though I'd be interested in building chairs.  The modern chairs I grew up with never struck a aesthetic cord.  It's a chair, you sit in it.  Then I started looking at the stuff Chris Schwarz and others were doing and my biases started to change. Chris works incredibly hard to remove the barriers to chair-making. I guess it worked on me.  I'm going to try replacing my dining room chairs with Welsh Stick Chairs and see where it goes.  You may see some chairs in the making bread section, in the future. For now, we'll start with the most approachable example. *[See Stick Chair posts](/tag/stick-chairs)*<br>[![bulls%$t-chair](https://euclidstoolworks.github.io/substack-automation/assets/bs-chair.jpg)](https://lostartpress.com/products/build-a-chair-from-bulls-t) |

*This is only the beginning, Euclid's Toolworks. How about you. I'd really like to hear what all y'all got goin' on.  Is there something you'd like to see me try?*

[^1]: These are the projects that will hopefully keep the shop going, or at the very least are an expression of Euclid's Toolworks' purpose.
