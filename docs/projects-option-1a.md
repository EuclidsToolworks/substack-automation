*Hey, woodshop crew! I’m elbow-deep in sawdust, figuring out hand tools and sketching geometric dreams. Here’s what’s cooking—drop a tip or subscribe!*

### Building The Foundation

| **Shop Setup** | Sharpening chisels with diamond stones is like taming a grumpy cat—slow, but they’re purring now. My shop’s ready to roll! *[See Shop Setup posts](/tag/shop-setup)*<br>![Chisel pile](shop-setup-image.jpg) |
| **Roman Workbench** | This workbench is my shop’s big kahuna—joinery older than my toolbox. Pray I don’t botch the tenons! *[See Roman Workbench posts](/tag/roman-workbench)*<br>![Workbench sketch](roman-workbench-image.jpg) |
| **Tool Chest** | Crafting a chest for my tools, with joinery snappier than a stand-up comic. My shop’s VIP lounge! *[See Tool Chest posts](/tag/tool-chest)*<br>![Chest dovetails](tool-chest-image.jpg) |

### Crafting With Meaning

| **Bookcase Refurbishment** | My ‘60s bookcase—old comic stash—is rocking Euclid’s geometric carvings. It’s my shop’s librarian with flair! *[See Bookcase posts](/tag/bookcase)*<br>![Carving detail](bookcase-image.jpg) |
| **Other Projects** | Euclid’s Door sets, pentagonal frames, and a Steinbeck pencil cup are bubbling up. My bench’s begging for action! *[See Other Projects posts](/tag/other-projects)*<br>![Project sketches](other-projects-image.jpg) |
