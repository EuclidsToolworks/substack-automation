### My Shop’s Big Bets

- **Roman Workbench: The Shop’s Heavyweight** *[See posts](/tag/roman-workbench)*  
  Building this joinery beast feels like arm-wrestling history—hope I don’t botch the mortises!

- **Tool Chest: My Tools’ Penthouse** *[See posts](/tag/tool-chest)*  
  This chest’s joinery is fancier than my Sunday shirt, keeping my tools safe from my chaos.

- **Bookcase Refurbishment: Retro with Swagger** *[See posts](/tag/bookcase)*  
  My kid-era bookcase is getting geometric carvings—think librarian with a punk edge.

- **Other Projects: The Dream Queue** *[See posts](/tag/other-projects)*  
  From photo frames to a Steinbeck pencil cup, my brain’s outpacing my bench.
