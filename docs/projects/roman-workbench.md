# Roman Workbench: My Shop’s Heavyweight

*This workbench is the boss of my shop-in-progress, built with joinery older than my toolbox. I’m stoked to craft something this solid, but man, those mortises are giving me nightmares!*

### Why It’s a Big Deal
I’m a hand tool newbie, so building a Roman Workbench feels like signing up for a marathon. It’s gotta be sturdy enough to handle my future projects, plus it’s a nod to ancient woodworkers. If I nail this, my shop’s set for life.

### Tools and Materials
- **Tools**: Saws, chisels, mallet—my joinery posse.
- **Materials**: Oak, because this bench deserves the good stuff.
- **Design**: Classic Roman style, low and tough.

### Where I’m At
I’ve got the legs roughed out, but cutting tenons is like defusing a bomb—one wrong move, and it’s toast. Any joinery tips out there? *[See all Roman Workbench posts](/tag/roman-workbench)*
