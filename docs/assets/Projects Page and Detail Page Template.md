*Hey, woodshop warriors! Welcome to Euclid’s Toolworks, where I’m channeling my inner *MacGyver* to build a hand tool haven, learn old-school woodworking, and carve some *TRON*-worthy geometric designs. Check out my projects below—it’s like *The Goonies* meets *This Old House*, with a dash of ‘80s MTV flair. Jump in, share your hacks, or subscribe to catch the weekly saga!*

### Laying Down the Groove
- **Shop Setup**  
  Sharpening my chisels and planes feels like facing the *Empire Strikes Back* Yoda test, but I’m wielding diamond stones to get my tools ready. It’s the foundation for my shop, *Ghostbusters*-style! [See Shop Setup posts](#)  
- **Roman Workbench**  
  This workbench is the *KITT* of my shop—sleek, sturdy, and built with classic techniques. It’s my next big quest, and I’m pumped! [See Roman Workbench posts](#)  
- **Tool Chest**  
  Like *Indiana Jones* crafting the perfect satchel, I’m building a chest to keep my hand tools safe and ready for action. Joinery, here I come! [See Tool Chest posts](#)  

### Crafting with Soul
- **Bookcase Refurbishment**  
  My ‘60s bookcase, straight outta my *Wonder Years* childhood, is getting a glow-up with Euclid’s geometric carvings. It’s gonna be the *Stranger Things* star of my shop’s library! [See Bookcase posts](#)  
- **Coming Attractions**  
  From Euclid’s Door sets to pentagonal family photo frames (think *Star Wars* family portrait!) and a Steinbeck pencil cup that’s pure *Breakfast Club* vibes, more projects are brewing. Stay tuned! [See Other Projects posts](#)

## Notes for Your Woodshop Mixtape
- **Substack Vibes**: Use ### and #### for headings, ** for bold, - for bullets. Toss in images (e.g., your chisel pile or bookcase sketch) via Substack’s editor for that *MTV* pop.
- **Links**: Swap # placeholders with tag URLs (e.g., /tag/shop-setup) or post URLs. Tags are like *Pac-Man*—easy to set up, auto-collect posts.
- **Tone**: *Ferris Bueller* meets *This Old House*—fun, chatty, with ‘80s movie, music, and computer science nods (e.g., debugging in *WarGames*). Tweak if you want more *Madonna* sass or *ALF* quirk.
- **Updates**: Refresh summaries as you go, like swapping tapes in a *Walkman*. Add post links weekly or when you feel the groove.
- **Images**: One pic per project on the index, 1–2 on detail pages, keeps it *Top Gun* sleek.

## Quick High-Five Questions
- Tone cool, or want more *Grease* swagger or *Blade Runner* nerd?
- Summary length: 2–3 sentences per project, or more *Karate Kid* depth?
- Images: Snap some tool pics, or keep it *WarGames* text-only?
- Links: Tags for *Pac-Man* ease, or hand-pick posts like a *Mix Tape*?
- Detail pages: More *Goonies* story or *TRON* tech specs?
